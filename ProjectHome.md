Code from the regular London Wicket User Group meet-ups.

[Apache Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org) is an open source Java web component framework. The London Wicket User Group meets up approximately every two months for a set of informal talks and general chatter.

## <a href='http://jweekend.co.uk/dev/LWUGReg/'>Details and sign-up for the next event</a>.**##**

There's often code behind the talks, and this site hosts that code in a Subversion repository. Here you'll find various components, snippets and applications. We try to keep this code up-to-date with the latest library and Wicket versions.

For slides and the original code (downloadable as ZIPs), please see the download page. We'll move the code into subversion soon.

Components available:
  * Generic bean editor component.
  * Generic drag-and-drop AJAX list editor component.
  * Dynamic AJAX image cropping component.
  * Gallery application (uses the list editor and image cropper).

Some of the projects depend on others (most depend on the "common" project), so you will need to build and install SNAPSHOTs of these dependencies into your local Maven 2 repository for these to be found. If you are having difficulty, ask on the [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/londonwicket) for this project.
